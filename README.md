# LeetCode-Practice-from-Scratch
This repo is created to record my process of practicing LeetCode coding problems.

# Acknowledgement
Thanks to [代码随想录](https://www.programmercarl.com) for giving a detailed instruction on **how to choose the problems** and in what **order** to solve them. I am following this guide to practice LeetCode problems.

# Array
## Binary Search
### The first time version: [Binary Search](Array/binary_search/binary_search.py)
#### Missing Keys:
1. when calculating the 'middle', I did not consider **overflowing of the integer type**, using 
```python
middle = (left + right) // 2
```
instead of
```python
middle = left + (right - left) // 2
```
2. referring to [solution](https://www.programmercarl.com/0704.%E4%BA%8C%E5%88%86%E6%9F%A5%E6%89%BE.html#%E6%80%9D%E8%B7%AF), remember to define whether the target is in the range of [left, right] or [left, right). Though in my version I consider the middle as a decision boundary.

#### Others to Note:
The conditions using **binary search** are usually **sorted** and **non-repetitive elements**.
